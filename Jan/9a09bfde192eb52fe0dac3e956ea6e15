 BEFORE THE APPEALS PANEL OF THE PRESS COUNCIL OF SOUTH AFRICA In the matter between: Matshela Koko                                                                                  Applicant/Complainant and News24                                                                                                                Respondent Matter No: 9322/10/2021 DECISION ON AN APPLICATION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL “News24 found that an increase in planned maintenance in 2015 was not sustained during Koko’s tenure, which, in addition to damaging practices of running power generation units hard, led to a sharper than expected increase in unplanned breakdowns after his departure”. In refuting the above, the applicant attached page 130 of the Eskom Integrated Report of 31 March 2021, which had been audited by independent external auditors. The respondent stood its ground. The Deputy Press Ombud dismissed the applicant’s complaint in which the applicant had demanded a retraction and an apology. The applicant now seeks leave to appeal the Ruling. The respondent opposes the application. For the application to succeed, the applicant must show reasonable prospects of success on appeal. Dated this 22nd day of January 2022 Judge B M Ngoepe, Chair, Appeals Panel
